# My-Learning-Journal

Tech Degree Project 5

Unit 5:

This was a TreeHouse Tech Degree Project

This project was to build a website using Flask, HTML, and CSS for a learning journal.
The project was to create an Entry model, an Entry form and views for each page. The 
views were, / and /entries, /entries/new, /entries/<int:entry_id>, /entries/<int:entry_id>/edit, 
/entries/<int:entry_id>/delete. Each view had it's own template made for it as well. All 
templates were extensions of the layout.html.
